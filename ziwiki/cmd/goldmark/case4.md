You can also use variant modifiers to target media queries like responsive breakpoints, dark mode, prefers-reduced-motion, and more. For example, use md:backdrop-brightness-150 to apply the backdrop-brightness-150 utility at only medium screen sizes and above.

## code

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from ../util import fate

def FunctionType():
    return a + b
```
